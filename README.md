# MY FIRST STORY – Second Limit

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Wha't wrong and what's right?
You get lost a little more inside

Wha's is ture, just let it go then

By now you'r figured out that
Compromise is the way of life

But that just makes you faded out
Shadow in the crowd

Nothing! Nothing! まるで!
Your losing! そうだったんだろう?
Get over with your old days
現実逃避 Wake up‼閉じこもんなよ!
Search for a brand new day
You'll never take us alive! Don't miss it!

What's gone and what's left?
You get caught a little more inside
Nothings mine Just let it go them!

Reason you always want it.
It can take you not as far you know what really save you fullfils
You see it
'Cause it's right there

Nothing! Nothing! 今更!
Your losing! 言えなったんだろう?
Get over with your old days

疑心暗鬼 Stay out‼閉じ込もんなよ!
Search for a brand new day
You'll never take us alive! Don't miss it!

Every moment you feel down
No one care about you you know?
(Their is no fear at all)
Till the dowing of new day
Lay down cauch with your old dream
(So from now) you have to move!
Every past has mean standing at the edge.
You're waiting for the time!

Nothing! Nothing! No more!
Never listen to them
If you wanna make it better
Break it just trust yourself!

悩んで 病んで 同じ!
気付いて 傷ついてんだろう?
Get over with your old days

疑心暗鬼 Stay out!閉じこもんなよ
Search for a brand new day
You'll never take as alive! Don't miss it!
